# Vision
A backend system for video sharing website with registration, subscribing, etc.

Developed RESTful APIs included user register, log in (RSA, MD5), and JWT token verification. Also achieved user subscribe and Fans categorization function, using RocketMQ and Redis to publish and broadcast message to all subscribers.

And I used FastDFS to manage video resources, and also used Nginx to achieve load balance.

ElasticSearch and Kibana is implemented for search the video you want from webpage.
